## Description

I add a short description of my contribution.

## Todo list
- [ ] add the right label depending on the type of contribution (`content`, `code`, `design`)
- [ ] add the label indicating the status of my PR (`WIP` for work in progess, then `RFR` when my PR is ready)
- [ ] add a screenshot if it makes my contribution easier to understand
- [ ] add tests if my contribution consists of code
- [ ] Replace this todolist for the real todolist of my contribution
